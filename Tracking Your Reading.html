<h1>Tracking Progress of Your Goals</h1>
<p>It is important to keep track of what you've read so you will know what you like and don't like! This makes your future reading easier to choose as well as helps you learn about your personality as a reader. </p>
<p2> One way that readers keep track of their reading is using tracking apps, such as:</p2>

<ul>
   <li>Goodreads</li>
   <li>StoryGraph</li>
   <li>Litsy</li>
<br>

<p3> Another way to track your reading is with a reading journal. This can be as simple as something you write down in a notebook. Some things that I like to include in my reading journal are: </p3>

<ul>
    <li> Title of book and Author Name</li>
    <li> Short summary of book </li>
    <li> My own thoughts: What I liked and didn't like about this book </li>
    <li> Overall Rating: I do stars! For example, a book that I really liked will be a 5 star book. </li>
