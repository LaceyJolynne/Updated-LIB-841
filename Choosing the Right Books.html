<h1>Choosing the Right Books</h1>
<p>Some Helpful Tips to Ensuring You're Reading the Right Book for You!</p>
<p2>I personally never read a book I am not enjoying past <b>page 60.</p2>

<h3> Using the <b>Five Finger Rule</b>.</h3>
<p3> Open the book to the first full page. Read it silently and hold up a finger each time you find a word you do not know. If you hold up five fingers, it may be too difficult to read <b>RIGHT NOW</b>. This does not mean it will be too difficult forever, but for right now, try to find something else!</p3>
